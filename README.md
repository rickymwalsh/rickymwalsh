### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ricky, a Data Scientist from Ireland <img src="https://www.countryflags.io/ie/flat/16.png">. You can find me on [LinkedIn here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricky-walsh/).

Currently studying a MSc in Data Science, after having worked for four years in data analytics. 
Especially interested in applications of data science within the healthcare, clean energy and not-for-profit sectors.

The repositories below contain the code for several projects during my masters, as well as some utility functions I've written in R or Python over the last few years.

[redi-xai](https://github.com/rickymwalsh/redi-xai) is a project in Explainable AI, exploring how bias in data affects the predictions of an AI model trained to detect skin cancer from images of skin lesions. We aim to publish a paper on this project to a scientific journal later this year. 

[detect-af](https://github.com/rickymwalsh/detect-af) concerns the automatic detection of Atrial Fibrillation episodes using Electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Relevant statistical features from the literature were identified & applied, and were used as inputs to decision tree and XGBoost models.

[IdMind](https://github.com/rickymwalsh/IdMind) delves into EEG biometrics. Using the brainwaves recorded by an electro-encephalogram (EEG), a Convolutional Neural Network is trained to distinguish between the brain patterns of 20 individuals. The idea is to enable authentication using the signals from our brain, which are more difficult to spoof (vs. fingerprint or iris scans).

[Facial-Tracking-Features](https://github.com/rickymwalsh/Track-Facial-Features-3D) is a small project as part of an initial image processing course. Given videos of participants carrying out a set of tongue exercises, the objective is to track the movements of their tongue, nose and eyes from three different angles, and pinpoint the locations in 3D space.

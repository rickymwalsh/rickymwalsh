### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Ricky Walsh, Data Scientist from Ireland <img src="https://www.countryflags.io/ie/flat/16.png">.  Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricky-walsh/).

Currently studying a MSc in Data Science, after having worked for four years in data analytics. 
Especially interested in applications of data science within the healthcare, clean energy and not-for-profit sectors.

The repositories below contain the code for several projects during my masters, as well as some utility functions I've written in R or Python over the last few years.

The `redi-xai` repo corresponds to a study which we aim to publish in a scientific journal later this year.
